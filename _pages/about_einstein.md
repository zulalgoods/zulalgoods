We are dedicated to providing a safe and welcoming environment for all Muslims. We offer a variety of services including Friday prayers and Islamic education for children during the academic year on Saturdays.

Our goal is to promote a better understanding of Islam and to foster a sense of community among Muslims in the area. We welcome all Muslims to join us in worship and fellowship.
